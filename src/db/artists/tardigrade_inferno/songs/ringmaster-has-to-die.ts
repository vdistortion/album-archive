It's an absurdity, it's his fault
It was just an innocent somersault
With hands tied and torn out hair
Down my magnificent office stairs

I just came and saw this scene -
He was drinking gasoline,
Then he put himself on fire
Right before it, he was fired

Hope you die, I hope you would
But I don't want to ruin the mood
Can you see with your own heart
How the audience love this part

When we're on the stage
You will hear our cry
Trapped inside the cage
Hoping you would die
Ringmaster, ringmaster
My life is a disaster
Forgive me, it’s over
Ringmaster has to die

So you want me to step down?
Be replaced by a random clown?
And the answer’s on the surface
Only I can run this circus
Who can run it if not me?
We don’t need uncertainties
Clowns and jugglers will do fine
Suit yourselves after I die

When we're on the stage
You will hear our cry
Trapped inside the cage
Hoping you would die
Ringmaster, ringmaster
My life is a disaster
Forgive me, it’s over
Ringmaster has to die

Hope I die? I never will
The circus will burn, I’ll be standing still
Can you see with your own heart
Now we are ready for the final part

It's an absurdity, it's not my fault
Half of the circus just died of cold
I heard that you love me here less and less
So I’ve prepared for you something else

First time on the stage
Fighting for their lives
Locked inside the cage
What will they contrive
To survive?

Ringmaster, ringmaster
My life is a mess
And every time I close my eyes
I hope it would hurt less
And we’ve been trapped here for some time
It feels like thousand years
And every time I close my eyes
I hope you disappear
Please just die

When we're on the stage
You will hear our cry
Trapped inside the cage
Hoping you would die
Ringmaster, ringmaster
My life is a disaster
Forgive me, it’s over
Ringmaster has to die
